## 2.5.0 — Import-health detection, watch-folder canary & non-music filter

Makes silent Lexicon-import failures impossible to miss, and keeps non-music out
of the DJ library.

### Added
- **Empty-import is now a hard, distinct failure.** When `POST /v1/tracks`
  returns HTTP 200 but imports **0 tracks** (the signature of a Lexicon host that
  has lost the NAS music mount), `_lexicon_find_or_import` now raises
  `LexiconImportEmpty` instead of silently returning `None`. The track is set to a
  clearly-messaged error state tagged `[lexicon_import_empty]`, and the failure is
  counted and surfaced (it is no longer swallowed as success or a generic error).
- **Proactive import-health canary** (`sync-worker/tasks/lexicon_health.py`, runs
  every 15 min). For the current watch-folder architecture it verifies the two
  NAS-side dependencies of the import flow **before** real imports fail:
  (1) WaxFlow can write to the staging/watch dir (`/downloads` → NAS
  `/volume1/music/Input` → Lexicon's watch folder), and (2) the Lexicon API is
  reachable. On failure it raises a loud, specific status.
- **Import health on the API** — `GET /api/admin/health` now returns
  `import_health`, `lexicon_mount_ok`, `import_health_detail`,
  `import_health_checked_at`, and `lexicon_import_empty_count`. Overall `status`
  degrades to `degraded` when imports are broken, so a Kuma/HTTP check on the
  endpoint pages instead of hiding.
- **Self-heal monitor** (`scripts/monitor-parity.sh`) reads `import_health` and
  logs a `CRITICAL` line + optional webhook page (`WAXFLOW_ALERT_WEBHOOK`) when
  imports are silently failing. It deliberately does **not** restart containers
  for this (a restart cannot remount the Mac's NAS share).
- **Non-music ingest filter** (`sync-worker/tasks/nonmusic_filter.py`) — Spotify
  items that are not music are skipped at poll time: podcast episodes / audiobook
  objects (`type != track`), audiobook/spoken-word keywords (LibriVox, audiobook,
  `chapter N`, unabridged, …), and anything over a configurable duration cap
  (default 30 min). Skips are logged as `nonmusic_skipped`, never silently.

### Config keys
- `nonmusic_filter_enabled` (default `1`), `nonmusic_max_duration_ms`
  (default `1800000` = 30 min)
- `lexicon_canary_interval_seconds` (default `900`)
- `lexicon_watch_dir` (default `/downloads`) — staging/watch dir the canary checks

### Tests
- `sync-worker/tests/test_import_health.py` — empty-import detection, organize
  routing, watch-folder canary, and the health recorder's transition-gated paging.
- `sync-worker/tests/test_nonmusic_filter.py` — non-music rule coverage.

### Notes / unchanged
- The dedup/link/import guards and the Drift/Drifting matcher are untouched and
  continue to pass.
